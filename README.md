# React Expense Tracker

Loosely based on a Udemy course, with more up-to-date usage of babel and webpack,
react-redux, react-router, reacting-testing-library and react itself. I also
used a different date-picker and added additional functionality like sort order
and sort by description. My testing approach was vastly different and does a
better job of modelling user interaction.

## Gratitude

While I did a lot of things independently, big thanks to Andrew Mead for his [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/). I tip my hat!
